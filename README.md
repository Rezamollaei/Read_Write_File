This C program demonstrates file handling by performing three main tasks:

Text File Operations: It allows the user to enter information about persons (ID and name), which is then written to a text file (file.txt). It also reads the contents of this file and prints the data (student name and ID).
Binary File Operations: It defines a struct containing three integers and writes multiple records to a binary file (mybinary.bin). Afterward, it reads and prints the contents of this binary file. The program showcases both text and binary file I/O operations, with appropriate error handling for file opening failures.
